                <h1>Basic Background Information</h1>
                    <p>
                        I grew up outside of a small country town in Northern Rivers of NSW, Australia. I completed year 12 Higher School Certificate and gained an ATAR but scored poorly due to my personal disregard for the approach to assessing students, coupled with the knowledge I had already secured employment lined up. I joined the Australian Defence Force (ADF) on my 19th birthday, enlisting into the Royal Australian Corps of Signals within the Army to be trained as an Electronic Warfare Operator. I have been employed within the trade for 7.5 years and further pursued my IT focused interests when presented the opportunity to specialise as a Technical Analyst. This resulted in numerous opportunities that expanded on my appreciation and understanding of communications and IT systems, including working closely with members trained in tactical cyber operations. I’m now looking to transition away from military life, having found my soul mate and expecting to be a father in the near future, I am studying to upskill and gain qualifications to better my employment opportunities in the future.

                <h1>An Interesting Fact</h1>
                    <p>
                        My grandparents were a major support and influence in my life growing up. My Grandpa is a Vietnam veteran who was always telling me stories of his time in the Army; the friendships he made, the importance of respect, discipline and caring for those around you, but also the importance of always having a little fun no matter where you were. He is absolutely my key role model in life and it was he who lead me to joining the ADF. I absolutely blame him for the professional rapscallion I am today. I can also blame him for my motivations towards making IT more understandable and secure, his refusal to figure it out for himself when he can just call on me has provided plenty of opportunities to see where technology could improve. The final thing I wish to blame him for is my ridiculous obsession with slurping out the dregs of any milkshake, especially in public.

                <h1>Describe Your Interest in IT?</h1>
                <br>
                    <p>
                        <b><i>The Tinkering Toddler</i></b><br>
                        Ever since I was a little kid, I have been interested in technology holistically. I can recall my family owning a VCR player and old school TV and despite my parents’ instructions, my five-year-old self would play around with the cables and settings until I understood how it all worked better than anyone else in the household. Growing up with seeing IT systems evolving and taking on such a significant component of our lives, my natural curiosity and determination to understand how the world around me worked, resulted in a focus on IT.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>A "Town" Wide Web</i></b><br>
                        This interest in IT expanded in high school. Unlike many school mates who lived in town and could walk to see one another, my significantly nerdier group of friends all happened to live outside of town in opposite directions. For us to interact outside of school, we all relied on the internet to communicate, play and study together. Social media, gaming, collaboration tools, online research and entertainment all became a significant part of our lives and for a select few of us, core to our identity as our taste for all things IT grew.
                        <br>
                        In my senior years, I knew I wanted to work within IT and due to the influence of my social support networks, I completed year 12 with subjects chosen to gain an ATAR with the initial intent to go to university after school. I did Math, English, Japanese, Chemistry and Software Design & Development (SDD). While I have always enjoyed learning, I quickly concluded that the method schools assess ability didn’t mirror my capabilities or interests. Once I established that I was going to join the Army after high school, I let go of the goal to score a high ATAR and instead utilized the schools’ resources and classes to sate my interests. In doing so, I found that all of the subjects could serve to benefit and relate back to IT in some way.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>IT Is Connected To Everything!</i></b><br>
                        Studying Japanese expanded my cultural horizons from the small world of my country town. I travelled to Japan for two weeks through school and was marvelled by the stark contrast between tradition and technological advancements coexisting side by side. I also found the study of a language so distinct from English, actually aided in my ability to understand program syntax and track data flow. Chemistry met my curiosity of how things work and interact in the world around me, providing me with insights and an appreciation into material requirements for IT hardware. English entertained my philosophical interests and developed my tastes for debating ideas and approaching views from alternate perspectives. This supported my capacity to approach the same software problems from multiple angles to find alternate solutions when compatibility became an issue. Math was always something I considered important and I’ve always liked solving puzzles, naturally software development and all elements of IT are stemming from mathematics so this served me well. The SDD class was my true passion in school. I invested majority of my out of school study time towards learning more about IT and programming, familiarizing myself with the terminology, languages and just generally tinkering with mine and the family computers to see how they ticked. I fondly recall the times my IT teachers would often tell me that what I was asking about was “beyond the scope of this course” and that “what you’re interested in and asking about is the stuff you’ll learn at university”. Despite this, I knew that university wasn’t the path forward for me.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>A Nerdy Soldier</i></b><br>
                        I took my interest in IT and sort to develop skills through work within the Army. The job was advertised to meet my thirst for working within the IT field but also my interest in problem solving and intelligence. I gained a high-level security clearance and have been exposed to unique capabilities and training. With 7.5 years of experience within the field of communications, my interest in IT has grown insatiable. My consideration and awareness of the security elements of IT has taken a pedestal within my priorities. However…

                    <br>
                <h1>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Once I specialised as a Technical Analyst within the ADF, I began to notice I was missing broader fundamentals of IT knowledge. I’ve never been one to simply accept having knowledge gaps once I become aware of them so until now, I’ve mostly done a lot of my own unrecognized, uncertified online study. I networked with my peers to form closer relations with those who had more broader IT training and learned a great deal from them. However now that my personal circumstances have changed, gaining recognised qualifications for civilian IT employment has become a priority. Where once I did not feel suitable for tertiary study, I’ve since become equipped with far more life skills, maturity, professional experiences, opportunities and achievements, and an understanding and appreciation of how the wider world works. Noting my ability to navigate advanced skills within the environment already, I came to the conclusion that I could in fact take on an IT university degree. Naturally though, my ATAR was quite poor and again due to personal circumstances, I would prefer to study the degree entirely online. So, when my partner told me she would be studying a Bachelor of IT with RMIT through Open Universities Australia, I enquired for more information about it. By the time she was done telling me about it, I decided I wanted a piece of that and to study alongside her.

                <h1>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Put simply, I wish to learn as much as I can. I want to go down every rabbit hole and sprint across every field, absorbing all the senses until I am thinking, breathing and living like a true to form SCI-FI artificial intelligence. But seriously, I understand that the realm of IT is as wide as it is deep. With my work experience, I can appreciate this more than most who are newly beginning such studies. I expect this course will give us the broader training so that we as individuals are then equipped to choose our own paths for which to deepen our knowledge and skills. From working in collaborative teams, to understanding various project solution approaches, to learning about programming languages, to the basic functionality of input-process-output of a computer, to network functionality and subsequently network vulnerabilities, from building web applications to corporate-wide software suites, to system administration, client troubleshooting and hardware awareness. I could go on and on about automation, virtual machines, remote access, social media and subsequent social engineering and the wide array of negative impacts that coincide with the positive impacts of information systems in our day to day lives. IT has integrated itself into every aspect of our lives and therefore it’s as diverse as you and me. I expect to learn the basics of these core areas that IT affects our day to day lives. I expect to be equipped with the knowledge, tools and perhaps even connections to be enabled to branch out and gain expertise on my own, both during and on completion of this degree.

                <h1>What makes the position appealing to you?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Both of these positions are appealing for a multitude of factors. First and foremost, quite simply are the pay groups and job security. I’ve spent the entirety of my working life within the Defence Intelligence community and have acquired an appreciation for the job security and other perks that come from working within such organisations. However, the pay group I am currently on, pales to the level of work and effort I have contributed and the skill sets I have acquired to date. The ranges of $90-100K are more in line with what I know my worth to be as starting pay in this organisation. As my current position holds close ties to the Australian Signals Directorate, a transition from soldier to civilian and maintaining familiarity within this environment is a natural next career step.

                <h1>Skills, Quals & Experience Required</h1>
                    <p>
                        As discussed in my background and IT interests, network security is of a significant interest to me and both positions are enshrined in leading teams and driving organisational understanding in this area. Both positions would require a firm grasp of IT systems, corporate knowledge, communication security, government classification and policy compliance, communicating and mentoring subject matter expertise to superiors, subordinates and stakeholders and ultimately a natural interest in keeping up with technical advances and understanding their impacts on a broader than average scale. While the positions do not articulate specific qualifications, tertiary education within the realm of IT will heavily assist in the merit of reflecting baseline knowledge and capacity to work and communicate effectively within this area. The senior management positions of APS 6 and EL1 levels will also require evidence of experience within Defence environments and leadership roles. Any further evidence of subject matter expertise in the form of prior work experience or recognized qualifications will contribute a long way towards securing these positions. Finally, both positions require Top Secret Positive Vetting security clearance and an Organisational Suitability Assessment.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h1>Existing Skills, Quals & Experience</h1>
                    <p>
                        I’ve been employed within the ADF as an Electronic Warfare Operator for 7.5 years and have 2.5 years of experience specialised as a Technical Analyst. This time in service has provided me with a TSPV security clearance, prior exposure to ASDs infrastructure, extreme levels of familiarity with navigating high level complex policies and legislation, training in dissemination of tailored products in the forms of training packages, reports and briefs for superiors, subordinates, customers and key stakeholders and an expanded awareness of communication systems and networks and the protocols and hardware capabilities that translate into and determine how they operate and function. I’ve had opportunities to attend conferences within the international intelligence community which have provided unique insights into focus areas for future improvements, sustainment and short falls and capability gaps. This enabled me to become a key driver for implementing new and improved capabilities within my unit and subsequently developing training packages and mentoring the next generation of specialists within my team. This degree of corporate knowledge coupled with my motivation to contribute towards better IT & communication security for all, I believe equips me with the perfect insight drivers to fulfill and eventually excel within these job roles to make a positive difference that is bigger than just myself. Furthermore, I’ve completed multiple SANS courses (without certifying) SEC573 Automating Information Security with Python, SEC560 Network Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking, SEC617 Wireless Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking and FOR498 Battlefield Forensics and Data Acquisition.

                <h1>Plan To Achieve</h1>
                    <p>
                        By taking on this Bachelor of IT through RMIT and aiming to complete within 3 years of full-time study, I expect to fill and develop on the areas that are knowledge gaps of the fundamentals I have experienced throughout my career. With a broader understanding of the fundamentals of IT, I hope to be in a better position to develop skills which complement and support my current specialist branches of knowledge. During this time, I also intend on maintaining and consolidating the skills I learned through my SANS courses. On completion of the IT degree, I will seek to undergo the SANS certification exams for the courses I have completed to expand on the qualifications I can list. This timeline also couples well with my personal life circumstances and the opportunity to relocate for employment purposes then. At this time, with the list of qualifications I will have attained, coupled with my previous working experiences and skills, the contacts I’ve established over the years and further maturity valued in such an environment, I expect I will be a prime candidate for these senior positions.

                    <p>
                        <b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br><br>
                        The best way I can describe the campaigner personality type is as the big dreamers that can never settle. Our curiosity and enthusiasm is always driving us forward, which can unfortunately lead to very distracted and overthinking minds. We are very people focused and this generally results in an appreciation of networking and seeing the world as one large connected organism. This often means developed communication skills and an altruistic mindset, which in turn leads to inspiring and influential social characters. The world is infinitely large and we endeavour to understand as much of it as we can, especially when it comes to understanding people and what makes us tick. With these considerations, we are natural mentors who like to question everything.
                        <br><br>
                        Unfortunately for us, this also leads to our biggest weakness which is the implementation and execution of our ideas in a practical manner. Being too focused on discussing ideas can detract from time spent realising them, not to mention becoming easily distracted by other ideas and overcommitting to other people and projects. This promulgates into an absolute contempt towards being micromanaged or restricted, an easy source of heightened emotional expression and stress. We generally know what is being asked of us, we just need the freedom to accomplish it rather than having a superior or colleague riding our grill to get it done. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Teamwork</i></b><br><br>
                        The ENFP personality will generally thrive in a team environment. We are creative and flexible and can understand alternate perspectives effectively to ensure cohesion where others may generate confusion due to communication gaps. We also are generally good motivators as we gain infectious excitement, believing in the intrinsic motivation of doing things for the enjoyment, potential and curiosity of simply doing it. The key thing to watch out for here is that this excitement can often lead to us derailing from the subject at hand and potentially wasting time that could otherwise be spent more productively. It is in these instances where someone with higher levels of discipline and organisational skills can assist in keeping things on track by being assertive when necessary. While other personalities may see collaboration as a pyramid hierarchy, my personality type frequently looks at collaboration as more of a mesh network with everyone talking together through the most direct and effective routes to optimize efficiency and help ensure everyone remains on the same page. This can go both ways when interacting with other personalities depending on how those in the team feel, some may appreciate the level of open dialogue and updates, however others may feel this inappropriate, irritating or too intrusive, which can lead to stepping on others toes unintentionally and unnecessary group turmoil. Finally, while people with my personality type can be great at motivating, organising, analysing and generating ideas, our poor practical skills can often mean poor timeliness and procrastination for more mundane tasks like writing up the final reports or compiling all the documentation. When it comes to teamwork, having someone working alongside who is happy to assist with this, or even just motivating the ENFP personality to get it over and done with for the feeling of accomplishment, can be a significant help towards meeting deadlines and accomplishing the big ideas we like to find.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Critique</i></b><br><br>
                        Now understandably, many people argue the legitimacy of the Myers-Briggs personality test as they are extremely easy to manipulate if you are clever and are increasingly susceptible to people answering the questions as a representation of who they feel they are as opposed to who they actually are. However as with most things in life, if you are lying to yourself, then you are undermining yourself and of course ruining your chances of accurately reflecting and learning about oneself. I’ve been familiar with this personality test since I was 17 years old and have completed it many different times over the years in many different forms. All bar once I scored ENFP and the one time I didn’t was ENTP by 1% which is just indicative that I am close to balanced between my priorities of thinking and feeling. I’ve always been one who holds honesty as an important policy, which has frequently caused me to land myself in trouble in instances where superiors do not appreciate hearing the truth. I have personally always felt like the ENFP personality type mirrors my life extremely accurately. In fact, in times where I have found myself in difficult moments, referring back to this test has even helped me reconnect with who I am and understand why I experience and feel some of the things I do. It’s also proven several times a useful tool for me to both explain my uniqueness, hold confidence in myself prior to important presentations and briefings and even just function better within my work environment. Overall, I understand that the test can be criticized and I believe all things should be anyway, however I believe this to be accurate enough to be a gentle reminder of our strengths and weaknesses. Being aware of these will almost always enable a team to ensure that the best person for a specific area can take the lead and the team can cover individual weaknesses through harnessing strengths.

                        <b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br><br>
                        In my own words, the theorist is the concept learner. Rather than limiting our focus to what is right in front of us, we tend to see that as a gateway to conceptualizing a larger idea. We draw webs within our minds, collecting data and information and then connecting the dots until we have a working understanding of how and why these connections exist. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Teamwork</i></b><br><br>
                        At first, I thought it odd that I was provided this result but as I thought on it more, particularly within the team environments I’ve worked within the past, the Theorist learning style became something I began to understand better. Abstract memories and ideas came to me in bits and pieces and I realised how this has evolved into a core part of my strengths when collaborating in tasks, projects and courses. First and foremost is bringing forward the visual component of basic frameworks to ensure the team is communicating in a manner where everyone is on the same page. When it comes to discussing reasoning and justifications, I am often bringing up statistics and reports which have shaped my understanding and resulted in holding the opinions and approaches I have. I am also always happy to change these thoughts when new evidence is produced that I had not considered yet and am often eager to discuss this new knowledge with colleagues to find a new working theory. This of course, all backs up the inclination towards telling stories which help explain and grow a groups’ understanding through contextualizing the idea, work, evidence or theory. Lastly, I am always finding myself exceptionally involved when it comes to developing tools and tutorials designed to guide or mentor current colleagues or new team members through learning new systems or established practices. I find I am always eager to share with others, the knowledge of how and why things are connected as I believe this to better aid others in understanding why they are doing the steps they are taking and how it helps them get from point A to point B. 
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Critique</i></b><br><br>
                        Despite this being a shorter test, I believe this to be reasonably accurate. I do in fact spend a great deal considering and conceptualizing thoughts and lessons and finding ways that the current norm can be enhanced or better understood. This also somewhat backs off the ENFP personality type I am listed as, with being an explorer of ideas and wanting to understand everything in the world around me and discussing these with other people. This is further realised when you consider that Theorists like to take disparate facts and string them along to make sense of them, very similar to how we ENFP tend to see the world as connected in one way or another. I’d even consider this to be one of the primary reasons I am so inclined towards IT as it is one of our- if not THE primary means to connect.

                        <b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br><br>
                        I completed this as a further insight into learning styles as it, like the Honey & Mumford based test, was rather short and I felt could couple well together. What I take away from this is that I am actually quite balanced when it comes utilizing my senses to learn, however due to the Theorist result from the previous test, I am slightly more inclined towards visualizing concepts and ideas to provide a more readily communicated means of clarifying and expanding on learned skills and developed thoughts.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Teamwork</i></b><br><br>
                        Perhaps the way this most effects my integration within a team is in the areas of organisation and motivation. With so many ideas going through my mind all the time and trying to test, confirm and revaluate ideas, my focus is easily distracted and I can become increasingly forgetful or off task. I regularly write up calendars with colour coding to highlight different types and priorities so that I do not forget things. I am also frequently writing down seemingly chaotic notes all over a page which become snapshot prompts to remind me of thoughts to be addressed later when I have the time to translate everything into a more human-readable friendly format which tells a story that others can visualize.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Critique</i></b><br><br>
                        I’ve always known I’m a very visual person, however the degree for which I rely on visual senses for learning is debatable. I am often increasingly self-taught and very self-paced when it comes to learning so while I’ve done a great deal of reading and drawing diagrams, graphs and charts to help understand things, I just as frequently will need to consolidate my learned skills through actually performing the task or even listening to others discuss or lecture about skills and lessons, etc. Having said this, once again despite the shorter nature of the test, the percentages are close to balanced with my visual sense coming out slightly ahead which is a reasonable conclusion for me to draw on reflection. While I would not necessarily hold my breath that this is accurate to everyone, I imagine it points in the right direction for further research if an individual finds themselves interested in learning how to set themselves up to better study in the future.

                    <p>
                        <b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br><br>
                        The Birkman Method Questionnaire is perhaps the most detailed, researched and useful of these tests. It’s specifically aimed at enhancing your understanding of your unique “good fit” career or work environment to best set you up for job success. The BFL Report aligns interests, motivations and skills to daily activities which generally identify you and provides insights into jobs that are best suited to you. This is visually represented by a “Life Style Grid Report” which plots your Preferred Activities, Usual Style, Needs and Stress Behaviour, followed by a “Your Areas of Interest Report” which measures Interest Themes against Areas of Personal Interest between task and people orientation. It then provides a “Career Profile” which compares your results to others who score similarly to you and reflects work environments and job families that have proven effective matches for them. The final two pages of the report provide a very detailed and effective summary of all of this.
                        <br><br>
                        My preferred activities section is very close to the middle of the grid however lies within the yellow quadrant which is indicative or organising. This primarily highlights an interest in detailed activities in association with all quadrants, reflecting my tastes for keeping track, having a variety of interests, spending time working in different areas and having opportunities to work in areas of secondary interests.
                        <br><br>
                        My usual style section was well within the green quadrant, reflecting my communicating style with a moderate score for direct involvement and a high score for people oriented. This specifies that when working effectively I am assertive and enthusiastic and should seek a work environment that will value and appreciate my attributes of being competitive, flexible, spontaneous and adventurous.
                        <br><br>
                        The needs and stress scores are plotted in the same location, this is explained as one’s behaviour resembling unmet needs when becoming stressed. The score plots me within the creating blue quadrant however is extremely close to the communicating green quadrant. The moderate level of people-oriented needs with a balanced level of involvement from others is described as needing an environment and relationships that are interested in feelings as well as logic, providing time for complex decisions, clearly indicating who is in charge, are openly enthusiastic and allowing for personalised incentives. This translates into stress behaviours of ignoring social convention, becoming indecisive and disorganised, being evasive and finding it hard to act, seeing the worst possibilities and overthinking criticism.
                        <br><br>
                        The interest themes scored heavily around organising and communicating, with moderate creating and very low implementing themes. However, within those themes, my areas of personal interest included numerical, social service, artistic, mechanical and scientific categories as the top five, which vary widely between the associated interest themes. The numerical interest I suspect reflects my appreciation for data and specifically the accurate representation of data which is central to my workplace identity. I believe the social service interest displays my supporting interest of the numerical category in that I enjoy making data and information easier to understand and motivating those around me. I see the artistic, mechanical and scientific categories as underlying supports of the first two, appreciating visual stimuli as a means to ensure information is easily and accurately conveyed, helping others understand how and why things work the way they do and to make the most informed decisions going forward.
                        <br><br>
                        The two highest scoring job families were “Life, Physical & Social Science” and “Computer & Mathematical Science” which coincidentally align heavily with my personal values. Health and communication are tremendously important to me and both values are heavily intertwined with these job families. Given that I have a lifelong interest in IT, I am naturally interested in how this impacts on the way we communicate and how this effects our health.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Teamwork</i></b><br><br>
                        Considering this report provides a work environment needs and stresses section, I would refer to those as the primary impacts of my functioning and compatibility within a team. However, I will also add that the usual style and preferred activities sections may indicate that should I be placed within a team that is strictly hierarchical with very restrictive and isolated positions that focus only on very specific individual tasks, I would find it very difficult to collaborate with such a team productively. I imagine my motivation would defuse extremely quickly, my awareness of the wider project would reduce and my contributions would then become less efficient or effective. I would certainly feel that it would become less of a collaborative effort and more an individual effort of many people. Fortunately, in my experience most within the IT community are often insightful and eager to pass on knowledge or ideas, with a shared understanding that collaboration is key to success.
                        <br><br>
                        <b><i>Critique</i></b><br><br>
                        I have very little doubt about the accuracy of this assessment. With the focus on occupations, over 60 years of research and application, multiple extremely detailed and lengthy multiple-choice questionnaires and elaborate report which has mostly reflected a lot of my work experiences quite accurately over the 7.5 years, I would have to say it is exceptional in its validity. There is so much detail within the report that I have no doubt in the data accuracy. The only thing I could comment on and this would be a particularly picky criticism is the representation of the data. It is obviously an immense effort to design a method that caters to all career avenues, especially with so many new career paths becoming enabled due to rapid advances in technology and the integration of IT into our everyday lives. I like to believe I have an open mind and so I can quite easily see how my results point very distinctly towards an IT career and even distinctly align with the two ideal jobs I listed within this assessment, despite the report necessarily singling out IT as a category for my attention. I also acknowledge the report results draw extremely similar parallels to key points of my personality according to the Myers-Briggs results and even my learning style according to the Honey & Mumford results. Notably is the people-focused appreciation for communication, freedom and flexibility and working with visualisation for conveying concepts which may be more detailed or technical, involving complex data and stats which can often be seen within the realm of IT.

            <div class="workspace">
                <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>
                        As an avid Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition (D&D 5e) player and aspiring Dungeon Master (DM) which is the story teller and world builder who referees the game rules and adds narrative flare to the mechanics of the game for the other players, my project idea is in support of this. A simple standalone <i>Critical Cards</i> application with a very generic user interface and checkboxes designed to meet the circumstances of the players. Once the appropriate options are selected, they “draw a card” to determine the outcome electronically, thus reducing clutter at the table and improving convenience. This is not a part of the official rules of the game, but rather in support of them, giving greater consequences to the successes and failures of the players to enhance the experience for all the players. 
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h1>Motivation</h1>
                    <p>
                        I am extremely invested in D&D 5e with years of playing the tabletop with my friends in various regular groups. There already exist many IT projects which support or compliment the gameplay of D&D 5e, including Roll20, D&D Beyond, The Homebrewery, Steam workshop extensions to Tabletop Simulator and a variety of character sheet generators and dice rollers. This has led many players to bringing laptops and phones to the gaming table for the convenience over pen and paper. A common highlight of D&D 5e is critical successes and critical fails, when despite the odds, the dice either demand your achievements or doom your attempts. While cards and other homebrew rules have been made where you roll against tables to determine the detailed outcomes and flavour of these rolls, there doesn’t appear to be a simple GUI application that enables these to be quickly accessed by the players. With so many players and DMs turning to IT to enhance their gameplay, experienced players will certainly appreciate the convenience of an easy to use and easy to access program.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h1>Details</h1>
                    <p>
                        Within D&D 5e, a 20-sided dice is frequently used to determine outcomes of a situation, adding modifiers to the roll based on the characters strengths and weaknesses. As an extension to this, players enjoy adding additional rules for when a 1 (fail) or a 20 (success) are rolled on the dice, referring to them as criticals. This is most often occurring in combat, but can sometimes also occur outside of combat in roleplayed situations, whether it be interacting with Non-Player Characters (NPCs), overcoming traps, solving puzzles or just general world exploration. The project idea acknowledges these circumstances and sets up a series of checkboxes and radio buttons to reflect the situation and level progression of the Player Characters (PCs), so whenever they roll a 20 or a 1 in any given circumstance, they randomly determine further benefits/consequences.
                        <br><br>
                        The overall project in its initial plan is aimed at being finalised as a standalone executable file for PCs, however further developments could be made to translate it into a webapp or even a mobile app for usage on phones without requiring internet access. The title would be listed as D&D 5e Crit Cards. Underneath this would exist 4 tabs which identify the 4 different types of decks that can be drawn from; Critical Hits for Players, Critical Hits for DMs, Luck Cards and Critical Misses (Fumble). At the bottom of all these tabs, will exist a centred button with the text DRAW. Beneath this will be a text window which includes a title of the effect and a short description of what occurs. This text will change whenever the draw button is pressed and will randomly draw from the pool of options depending on what is selected by the checkboxes and radio buttons which vary based on the tab selected.
                        <br><br>
                        Within the Players tab, will exist two rows. The first row is 4 checkboxes to select what severity will be included within the draw and a recommended level range. These are Setback (from level 1), Dangerous (from level 5), Life Threatening (from level 9) and Deadly (from level 13). The second row beneath this will be a series of radio buttons indicating the damage types of Slashing, Piercing, Bludgeoning or Magic. Beneath these two rows will exist standardised button and text. The DMs tab would have the same layout as the Players tab, however would pull from a different pool of cards balanced specifically for the DM to use when the NPCs critically strike against players.
                        <br><br>
                        The Luck tab would simply have a radio button for Good Luck or Bad Luck. These are for circumstances outside of combat when a player rolls a 1 or a 20. The player keeps a good luck card until they wish to use it, a player keeps a bad luck card until the DM chooses to use it against them. Updated iterations of the project may include the option to input a PCs Name and preserve the good and bad luck cards they draw, enabling players to select the cards they’ve been allocated and revealing the card description within the text box as if they had clicked the draw button.
                        <br><br>
                        The Fumble tab would include 3 checkboxes and 4 radio buttons in a similar layout to the two critical hit tabs for Players and DMs. The check boxes denote the nature of the fail to be included within the draw; Embarrassing, Awkward and Shameful. The radio buttons reflect the nature of the attacks; Melee, Ranged, Natural, Magic. As per the other tabs, clicking the draw button will fill/change the text with a randomly selected effect chosen from the pools as determined by the selected options.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h1>Tools and Tech</h1>
                    <p>
                        This project can be achieved with using Python. It may not be the most optimal, but it would certainly be an entertaining approach and a good test of the skills developed in the parallel <i>Introduction To Programming</i> course most students of this course are currently completing. The user interface would be achieved through the use of the Tk interface otherwise known as the tkinter package. In order to achieve a single executable file, pyinstaller would be used to package the libraries and dependencies together with the project code. The component that poses the most difficulty would be generating the cards texts and associated tags and linking them to be pulled by a random module. The easiest path forward would be using an SQL database, however a clever use of dictionary keys attributed to nested dictionaries and lists of variables could achieve a similar outcome although much less efficiently and far more messy.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h1>Skills Required</h1>
                    <p>
                        For this to be project to be achieved, the most significant requirement would be motivation backed by a basic grasp of programming and working with python. Considering the tables and cards for the D&D 5e Critical outcomes already exist, there isn’t particularly a requirement for a comprehensive knowledge of D&D, only a basic understanding of what is being asked of the project. While it would be useful to have prior experience or skill with tkinter, pyinstaller and SQL databases, motivated programmers should be more than capable of independent research into these to complement their Python skills and achieve the minimum requirements of the project.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                <h1>Outcome</h1>
                    <p>
                        On completion of the project, the development will help ensure that these optional rules will be more readily available for D&D 5e groups to implement into their games. As with many IT solutions, rather than reinventing the wheel, it is simply offering a more convenient version of already existing solutions. Any D&D player can write up a list of events that occur and number them, rolling a dice to see what number is matched, or writing up cards and shuffling them to draw. Maintaining such tables, dice and cards can be cumbersome and perhaps a player may not have these handy at the time or simply forgot to bring them to a session. This project would ensure that everyone has access to such things digitally. Perhaps this could even become the foundation for development into a larger and more flexible tool that easily allows others to create their own tables of chance used to enhance their gameplay experience.
